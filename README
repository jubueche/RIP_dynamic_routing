Implementation of the RIP dynamic routing protocol. This protocol implements a distributed version of the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
The network consists of routers, interfaces and subnetworks. Packets can be sent to interfaces (e.g. intf: 192.168.1.1) or subnets (e.g. 1.45.0.0).
This Implementation also uses split horizon with poisoned reverse, to prevent the 'counting to infinity' problem.

How to run:
Start the lvns server with a given topology by e.g. $ ./lvns -t complex.topo
After starting the server, the command 'help' will give an overview of the available commands.
For each router in the network one can open a new terminal window and type $ ./dr -v dr1 or type $ ./dr to see the command options.
